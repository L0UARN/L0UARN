## Hi, I'm Louarn!

I'm interested in lots of aspects of computer science, and learning new stuff is what drives me.

I am currently a software engineering student at UBO (Brest, France), after finishing my CS bachelor's degree at the IUT of Lannion (Lannion, France) and 2 years of full-stack web development in apprenticeship at ID Interactive (Arradon, France).

On the side, I'm doing with game development using only open-source tools, like Godot, Blender and Krita.
