## Hi, I'm Louarn!

I'm interested in lots of aspects of computer science, and learning new stuff is what drives me.

I am currently a CS student at the IUT of Lannion (Britanny, France), and doing full-stack web development in apprenticeship at ID Interactive (Arradon, Britanny, France).

On the side, I'm experimenting with game development using only open-source tools, like Godot and Blender.
